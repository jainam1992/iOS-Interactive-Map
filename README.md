# iOS-Interactive-Map
 An iOS application where user can search and find distance and time estimation to reach destination.
 
Features implemented are:

1)  Used Static SJSU Campus Map image. (Not Google or Apple maps available in the market). 

2.) Zoom in/out: User will be able to pinch to zoom in/out on our map. The zoom level will remain persistentÍ¾ i.e., after you restart our app, the user sees the same zoom level where he had left it.

3.) Building detail: A screen with the selected building detail is presented when user taps on a specific building on our map. User will see page with following details:
   ->  Building name
   ->  Address
   -> Walking distance and time from users current location to the building
We have used Google API to retrieve the distance & time estimation from current location to destination building.

4.) Search: Allows user to search by building name and the found building is highlighted and centered on the map at zoom level 100%.
